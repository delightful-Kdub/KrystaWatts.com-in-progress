									<h1>Signature: Building a Collaboration Platform</h1>
									<span>Research, Architecture, and Design</span>
									<h4>
										The goal of this project was to design a collaboration platform to be used by Autodesk users.
										<a href="http://www.autodesk.com/" target="_blank">Autodesk</a> is a software company that makes a suite of tools used by architects, engineers, manufacturers,
										video game developers, and anyone else who works with 3D modeling. My teammates and I were a mix of 6 graduate
										students from the User Experience and Industrial Design Programs at Philadelphia University.

										<h2>Process and Methodologies</h2>
										<p>The project kicked off with an introductory presentation by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kevin-vandecar-7904851" target="_blank">Kevin Vandecar</a>, a
											Software Engineer at Autodesk. Mr. Vadecar spoke to my cohort about the software
											his company produces, their differing use cases, the technology they each run on,
											and gave us a high level understanding of how each application is used in conjunction
											with others to accomplish a project. Kevin Vandecar also spoke of the technical
											direction the company is headed in. Following this, he gave a demonstration of 3&amp;4D
											models made using an assortment of their products. </p>
										<center><p><strong>We moved through the project in the following phases:</strong>
												<br/>1. Research Phase
												<br/>2. Structural Design Phase &amp; Critique
												<br/>3. Visual Design Phase &amp; Critique
												<br/>4. Prototyping Phase &amp; Critique
												</p></center>
											<p>The effort to design this collaboration platform were collaborative itself, which worked
												to our advantage as we were experiencing similar frustrations and needs of our potential users.
												In each phase, responsibilities and mini projects were divied up among the 6 of us and then we
												resturned to eachother to combine our work. The fuit of our labor in each phase was then presented
												to, and critiqued by, a group of our peers. These presentations uncovered issues and unanswered
												questions in our designs, serving as a sort of test phase throughout the process. Every phase was
												iterative and punctuated with a critique session.
											</p>
									</div>

									<div class="col-md-5">
											<h2>1.  Research Phase</h2>
											<h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
											<p>Once we had some context under our belts, the first step we needed to take was to explore existing platforms.
												Everyone was given the same journey as a way to move navigate through existing applicaitons and interact with a
												majority of the respective features. <br/><br/><strong>The journey was this design critique cycle:</strong> <em><br/>Create Something,
													<br/>Critique it, <br/>Hand it off, <br/>Revise, <br/>Critiuqe again, <br/>and Approve.</em>
											</p>

											<p>The applications assigned to us to analyze and compare were <a href="https://basecamp.com/" target="_blank">Basecamp3</a> and <a href="http://www.dobambam.com/" target="_blank">BamBam!</a>.</p>

											<br/><p><strong>Basecamp</strong> is web-based project and task management platform. The main features of this
												application are to-do lists, public messaging, direct messaging, scheduled events or check-ins, and a &quot;bird's
												eye view&quot; of users' recent activity.


											</p>

											<br/><p><strong>BamBam!</strong> is also a web-based project managment platform. The main features BamBam! offers are detailed
												task attributes, custom workflows, permissions, milestone tracker, and accounts with multiple project capability.

									<div class="single-info">
											<div>
												<h3>Current State Flow Diagrams</h3>
												<p>As my team and I used each platform, we took notes and constructed a real-time user flow using post-it notes. These post-its
													were digitized and arranged into more infographic flows. These allowed my team and I to visually compare the flows, notice any
													bottlenecks, and make our notes and comments much more apparent at a high level.

								<div>
									<h3>Findings</h3>
									<p>After using the two programs ourselves mapping out their functionality, as it pertained to our user journey,
										we found that we had a list of recurring frustrations as well as a [short] list of features we were pleased with.<br/>
										<center><strong>My teammates and determined the biggest pain points to be:</strong>
											<br/> - Updates made to the task list were not live.
											<br/> - There was no file history.
											<br/> - Files were not associated to task/To-Do.
											<br/> - Tasks and Workflow were not directly linked to each other.<br/><br/>
										</center>
										The functionality that delighted us as we familiarized ourselves with the applications were both features found witin BamBam.
										The first was <u>the ability to assign tasks to specific users, as well as set other users as followers of the task</u>. The second
										functionality we liked a lot was the <u>ability to track other users' actions on the timeline</u>, or workflow, a feature we saw as
										an opportunity to maintain transparency as well as accountability. As we began to imagine what our platform would be like, we we sure
										to avoid or solve these four pain points while recreating the positive experiences we had.


										</p>

					<div class="row">
							<div class="col-md-5">
									<h3>User Research</h3>
									<p>My team had the opportunity to speak to a panel of professionals who regularly use collaboration platforms as well as Autodesk
										applications. As someone who has never used Autodesk tools, nor do I have much experience collaborating accross digital platforms, this
										was an eye-opening and welcomed session. As a UX designer, I was excited to make even more sense of my research so far, as well as gain
										further understanding.<br/>
										<center><strong>While there were several points made during this workshop, my team and I focused on 3 Insights:</strong></center>
											<br/> - Annotation is important and design intent should be communicated.
											<br/> - These platforms should be adaptable, rather than forcing the user to adapt to it.
											<br/> - Critiques should be leveraged into actions.<br/><br/></p>


									<h3>The Mission Statement</h3>
									<p>With much more familiarity with other collaboration platforms, Autodesk applications, the work of our potential users, and the needs
										of these users, we were ready to start ideating on the features and functionality of our own platform. However, before we could dive in,
										we needed to hammer out and state the goal of this application. After considering all we had learned so far, we boiled our goals down into
										the following mission:
									</p>

									<center><em><h4>"Our collaboration platform seeks to <u>bridge communication and knowledge gaps</u> between collaborators, as well as seamlessly <u>integrate all aspects of the platform with the associated file</u>."</h4></em></center>

										<h3>Future State Flow Diagram</h3>
										<p>
											Using the mission statement as a clearly stated goal, we used post-its to start mapping out the collaboration platform that had been
											developing in each of our heads. We focused on small interaction of the user journey, or features we wanted to include, and iterated
											on these interactions. Once we had several mini flows we began promoting the best versions of each mini flow and strung them together,
											constructing a greator, overarching future state flow.</p>

										<p>
											Through our research, we knew there would be 3 main roles to keep in mind as user archetypes: the manager, the in-house collaborators,
											and the outside collaborators. Below you can see where each user falls on the flow as they follow the journey that was assigned to us.

									<h2>2.  Structural Design Phase</h2>
									<p>The Future State Flow was an incredibly imortant product of our process that greatly informed the Structural Design Phase. The infographic
										allowed us to require only a glance to understand the general flow of our platform and the areas [or features] of the platform that may
										require close attention. Most importantly, our flow helped us to better visualize our interactions and how disparate features are connected
										to eachother.
									</p>
									<p>For this, the Structural Design Phase, my team and I worked independently on our own wires to present to the group. We agreed to work on
										large sections that may overlap to not only get the most accurate feel for each of our interpretations of the flow, but also to help brainstorm
										other sections of the flow for each other. Since wireframes are a common User Experience deliverable, myself and the other UX graduate students
										made the wireframes individually while the two Industrial Design students worked together to make a couple of wireframed pages to better explain
										more nuanced interactions that pertain to using Autodesk tools.
									</p>
									<p>Throughout this project, I assumed the main leadership role which required me to assign team members tasks, hold them accountable, organize our
										documents, send out summaries of our classes, meetings, and critiques to the team to make sure everyone was on the same page, and offer encouragement. During this phase, this
										position really ramped up. I set a deadline for my team to submit wireframes to our group's Slack chat and a second deadline for us all to post
										any critiques and vote for which set of wireframes we should use to build out the rest of the application. I asked the  ID students to send us
										thorough critques on each of the individual wireframes; I can't stress enough how invaluable their help was throughout this process. By fully
										critiquing even the structural designes we didn't move forward with, we were able to be better informed about what ideas to carry forward with,
										or change, in the full set of wireframes.
									</p>
									<p>The team voted to build upon the wireframes I made to design the structure of the rest of the collaboration platform. Everyone was assigned a
										section of the flow to make wireframes for and then resturn to group to help put them together. We presented the first full set of wireframes to
										gain feedback and work out kinks. The image below shows a selection of wireframes to illustrate some of the iterative changes that were made after
										recieving feedback.

								<div>
									<p>We found that our wireframes felt a little constricting especially on the workspace pages, where designers want&mdash;need&mdash;as much space as
										possible. For this reason, we made the header much thinner. We also realized we hadn't thought through some of the interactions in the left slide out.
										To address this, we moved some of the features that were in the left menu to the right slide out menu, where they would be accessible only when creating
										or critiquing projects in the workspace. Originially, though this isn't depicted in the selected wireframes above, the team thought we would model our
										messaging feature after that of Facebook and have it docked at the bottom of the screen. Again, this didn't seem to do much besides take up more precious
										real estate. In the iterations on the right, you can see that we opted to put messaging in the left slideout instead. Rather than including a button that
										lead to a list of the user's teammates, an iframe was used to place a scrolling list in the left menu so it was always accessible and required fewer clicks
										to interact with. Other changes, like the layout of the homepage [the first row of screens], were changes we made to better set ourselves up aesthetically.
										With the homepage example, it is worth noting that this layout eventually switched back to a version of its former self after recieving comparative feedback.

								<h2>3.  Visual Design Phase</h2>
								<h3>Design Brainstorm</h3>
								<p>After our wireframes were built we could move on to designing the visuals that would sit upon that established structure. We approached this phase just as we
									had done with the Structural DEsign Phase. I set a deadline for team members to submit 2 pages to the group. Everyone had to make a visual design for the homepage
									and the second page could be any one we wanted. We were also expected to design a possible logo for our product, a collaboration platform we decided to call
									&quot;Signature,&quot; referring to the electrongic signatures used to link users, files, and workflow tasks. This was mandatory for the UX students,
									though the ID students were encouraged to do they same. Our Industrial designers again worked together to send us several pages further illustrating hard-to-understand, field-specific features.
								</p>
								<p>There was then a second deadline for everyone to submit critiques for all pages and vote for which we should use as a visual guideline while we design the rest of
									our platform. Below are 4 of the 5 visual designs submitted to the group to decide on. The fifth design is the one we chose and it is shown in much more detail further down.

								<h3>Visual Design Iteration</h3>
								<p>The visual design we chose to use as our guide moving forward used a color pallet consistent with that used by Autodesk. It was clean and felt professional as well.
									With the design language established, we again worked individually on the same sections previously assigned to us during the Structural Design Phase. Each of us
									returned to the group with our the visual design applied to our respective sections and worked string them together into several pages portray the look of our overall platform.
								</p>
								<p>This larger product was then presented and critiqued. The feedback we recieved was very valuable, as we were too close to our design and needed the eyes of outsiders
									to point out choices we needed to revisit. Below you can again see how we iterated through this phase.



									</p>

									<center><em><p>*Note: The left slide out menu is my individual design as well the pages marked by the yellow box.</p></em></center>

						<div>
							<p>Most of what we changed had to do with visual clarity. In the second row, in my section, critique showed us that the buttons under each project were shaped a lot like the
								timeline to the right of that area. Because of this, there was a likening to the two features which had very different functions. In following two rows, there are workspace
								pages that required minor changes to more clearly indicate the interactions we were designing; like adding an arrow button abot the right menu. We also established a
								single format for the global navigation and addressed how this navigation would be different for outside collaborators who have fewer permissions [see the fourth row].

										<h2>4.  Prototyping Phase:</h2>
										<h3>The Final Product &mdash; <em>Signature</em></h3>
										<p>The final step was to put recreate our visual designs on our wireframes. We again worked individually to marry the wireframes and visual designs of
											our repsective sections. Each of us then made our sections interactive and ready to submit to each other by a given deadline. We set several meeting
											times to work toegther to combine the intereactive sections into a full prototype. Every UX team member acted as the expert on their section.
										</p>
										<p>When the prototype was complete and functioning in a fluid manner from section to section, our ID counterparts acted as our quality and usability
											testers. They looked for functionality bugs as well as inconsistencies in design and concept. With their help, the UX team members refined the prototype
											enough to present for another round of critique. This final feedback shed light on any persisting issues and lead to the final product you see here.
