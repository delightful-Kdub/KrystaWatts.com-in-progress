									<h1>User-Driven Design Project</h1>
									<span>Research and Architecture</span>
									<h4>This was an assignment for my Digital Experience Design class. The objective
										was to conduct user interviews and contextual research
									sessions using a task of our own creation. In partnered teams, we decided on a task
									for our users and wrote the interview script. The research sessions were
									conducted individually and then we came back together with our partner to combine
									findings so our analysis would come from a larger sample set. The
									problems we identified, and decided to move forward with, were done as individuals.</h4>

										<h3>Initial Hypothesis and Scenario</h3>
										<p>The parameters for this project were simply that the users had to start with an open
											browser. My partner and I knew we wanted to reasearch a topic within the medical industry,
											so we brainstormed tasks that would fit within the given criteria.</p><br/>
										<center><p><strong>The task we chose was this scenerio:</strong></p>
											<p><em>“Someone close to you has been diagnosed with
											prostate cancer.<br/>You want to act as their advocate
											and compile a list of <br/>treatments to ask the
											doctor about.”</em></p></center><br/>
											<p>We hoped that this task would be open enough for users to to take any possible route
												for finding cancer treatments. Our initial hypothesis was that our data may tell us about
												why some people would, or would not, be open to alternative medicine and if there was any
												crossover between these groups. I anticipated designing an informative website tackling
												the pros and cons of treatment methods on this spectrum from Eastern to Western Medicine.</p>

											<h3>User Flows</h3>
											<p>The clip at the top of this page was taken from one of my recorded user research sessions.
												I conducted five such sessions based around the task above. I revisted these recordings to
												map out each user's journey as they tackled the directive. Using color-coded Post-Its, I
												digitized all five flows. Orange was used for the users's steps; this is sort of their
												timeline. Yellow indicated direct quotes from the users. Finally, pink was used for my own
												observer insights.</p>

									<div>
										<h3>Affinity Cluster</h3>
										<p>The Post-its from all 10 user flows, mine and the ones created by my partner, were
											arranged into an affiity cluster to make sense of the data. I chose place this on a chart,
											and change the relative size of each clustering, as a way to visually convey my analysis of the data.</p>
										<center><p><strong>Topics that kept coming up in my research had to do with:</strong></p><center>
											<center>
												<p>Trust in the Medical Field</p>
												<p>Trust in Technology, or specifically the Internet</p>
												<p>Ideas about what treatments were more viable than others</p>
												<p>How users evaluate internet content</p>
												<p>and</p>
												<p>Thoughts about the task itself</p>

										<h3>Infographic</h3>
										<p>To summarize my findings, and create a more digestable set of data for analysis, I created the following
											infographic. I broke my users into 3 archetypes. The Non-Researcher is the user who let me know they would
											not perform this task in their normal life; this user prefers to go straight to a Subject Matter Expert.
											The Holistic Researcher is the user who would first search for general information to lay the foundation
											for the research specific to the task I gave them. The Task-Driven Researcher is the user who dives right in,
											beginning their search for treatment options as soon as I let them use the computer. The infogrphic follows the
											path of the Holistic Researcher and shows where the other two user-types generally joined the flow. In doing this,
											I came to realize that the problem here had more to do with how users search for information, rather than how they
											feel about types of medical treatments.</p>

										<h3>Personas</h3>
										<p>As my problem began to reveal itself, I knew I needed to create personas to design for. While I
											have 3 user archetypes in the infographic, the Non-Researcher consistently expressed that this exercise
											was far from reality for them, so  I chose to personifay only the Holistic Researcher and the Task-Driven
											Researcher, as these are the users who will fit into the target audience for the product that arises from my research.</p>

										<h3>Defining the Problem and the Solution</h3>
										<p>While I saw a few different experience problems in the journeys that could be addressed, all of which were different from my original hypothesis, I chose to focus
											on the issues my users had that were related to doing online research, rather than the issues specific to
											the topic of research I suggested. I decided to design a browser plug-in.</p>
											<center>
												<p><strong>Based on the needs of my users, <br/>I knew I wanted this plug in to have 5 key features:</strong></p>
												<p>1. Hide Questionable Content</p>
												<p>2. Highlight</p>
												<p>3. Screenshot</p>
												<p>4. Facilitate Note Taking</p>
												<p>5. Record Divergrent Browse History</p><br/>
											</center>
									</div>


				<div>
									<div>
										<h3>Feature Mapping</h3>
										<p>The next step was to plan the basic structure and hierarchy of my browser plug in.
											To do this I used Axure to overlay possible feature orientations on a browser screenshot.
											In the selection below, the top row of feature maps were designed to fit the plug in
											features within the browser window. The second row shows maps that presented the features
											falling outside the browser window.</p>
									</div>
							<img src="assets/images/FeatureMaps.png" alt="">
				</div>

				<div>
						<div class="col-md-5">
							<div class="single-info">
									<div>
										<h3>Wireframing</h3>
										<p>I chose the feature map in the center of the first row, above, to use as a basis for my
											wireframes. In my first iteration of wireframing, I found that the breadcrumbs were using
											nomenclature that may not align with the users scheme. I also found that this first set of
											wireframes lacked an indicator when certain elements were selected, or activated. In my
											second iterations I made sure to address these issues.</p>

										<h3>How this solves the problem and what problems will still need to be addressed</h3>
										<p>The concerns of my users were that they had trouble organizing their raw data,
											maintaining a simple, understandable, browse history, and accurately evaluating information
											they found online. My design sought to address each of these issues saving their searches,
											screenshots, highlights, notes, and browser history into a file tree while the plug in is activated.
											It also has an optional feature to dim sources that may be unreliable for objective information.</p>
											<p>I see equal advantage and disadvantage in flacing the features within or without the brower window.
												For example, I hypothesize that some users may prefer to maintain a full, unobstructed view of the
												content within the browser, while others may compromise this view for the ability to use the window
												in full-screen mode. My next step will be to build wireframes showing interactions with the plug in
												based on a feature map from the secon row. After that, further testing will be necessary to see which
												version users prefer.</p>
