									<h1>Visualizing Data Project</h1>
									<span>Data Analysis and Design</span>
									<h4>This was an assignment for my Digital Experience Design class. The objective
										was to become aquainted with the open source datasets, found on
										<a href="http://OpenDataPhilly.com" target="_blank">OpenDataPhilly</a>, and
										design a vizual way to interpret the data that interested us. There was a learning
										curve, as I am not a data analyst, and the biggest challenge proved to be designing
										a way to interact with the tables of numbers and symbols I found. Please note that
										the designs were to be 'inspired by the data' rather than accurately depicting the information.

									<h3>Primary Data: Finding the right information</h3>
									<p>I encourage every Philadelphia resident to explore the Open Data Philly website; it has a lot
										of surprising, and useful, information about things going on in Philadelphia, socially and
										developmentally. I began the initial part of this project believing I would choose a dataset
										that has to do with nightlife in the city. My focus quickly shifted as I came accross data relating
										to bigger issues in our community; there was information about poverty, education, and recreation,
										amongst other topics. Bicycling is a popular hobby in the area, and it took me several years to get
										aquainted with many of the trails and popular biking roadways. This lead me to be attracted to the
										<a href="https://www.opendataphilly.org/dataset/bike-network" target="_blank">Bike Network</a> dataset.
										 The abstract that was included with the data gave the following key for interpreting the data:
									</p>
									<p>FIELD NAMES AND DESCRIPTIONS:
								SEG_ID - Unique segment identifier
													STREETNAME - complete street name including directional prefix; street name; street type; directional suffix
													ST_CODE - street code, the unique street name identifier
													ONEWAY - travel direction of street segment, relative to the digitized direction of segment
													CLASS - Street classification related to traffic volume and drivability

												<ol>
											DOMAIN VALUES FOR FIELD CLASS:

											<li>Expressway</li>
											<li>Major arterial</li>
											<li>Minor arterial</li>
											<li>Collector</li>
											<li>Local</li>
											<li>Driveway</li>
											<li>Low speed ramps</li>
											<li>High speed ramps</li>
											<li>Non-travelable</li>
											<li>New roads under construction</li>
											<li>City boundary</li>
											<li>Walkway connector</li>
											<li>Traffic-controlled crosswalks</li></ol></p>

											<h3>Secondary Data: Combining Relevant Datasets</h3>
											<p>Two other datasets stood out as potentially being of interest to those who may enjoy being out in the
												city. The first of these two was the <a href="https://www.opendataphilly.org/dataset/philadelphia-national-historic-sites-and-landmarks">Philadelphia
													National Historic Sites and Landmarks</a> dataset. Included in this set is a list of historic landmarks and sites of interest with information including
													Object ID, type, geometry of site, and location coordinates. The second of these secondary datasets was the
													<a href="https://www.opendataphilly.org/dataset/crime-incidents" target="_blank">Crime Incidents</a> set which was inspired by various news stories
													about attacks against joggers and bicyclists, as well as my experience as a woman who has navigated cities alone.

										<h3>Michelle seeks features</h3>
										<p>I knew the datasets I chose would give the user access to locations of roads, pathways, and trails as well as the
											characteristics of those pathways as far as traffic congestion, driveability, and environment. The secondary data
											selected pointed out crime areas by type of offense, location, frequency, and how recent. Given these parameters of
											information, and considering the needs of my user, I decided I would need to have the ability to filter through the
											types of pathways and their characteristsics, turn on and off recent crime, and turn on and off historic site detection.
											In iterating through potential configurations of these features, I found that the feature map at the bottom of the below
											set would fit the features on the screen in what seemed like the least invasive and balanced manner, while keeping the
											directional, or fine tuning, controls to the bottom right for easy access.</p>

										<h3>How to interact with the data: Structural Design Iterations</h3>
										<p>I created an initial set of wireframes to plan not only what the feature map plotted, but also how the user would get
											to the visualized data. Below, on the left, you see this first iteration and included the second iteration to the
											right to offer direct contrast in approach. I was keen on an initial "interview" to gather the user's preferences
											before offering them the interactive map. Fot the first stab at the structural design for this application, I took a
											clickable approach with the intention of feeling like a game. There is the start of a sentence at the top of the
											screen and the user finishes the sentence by selecting their preference for this particular jog or ride. Once the user
											reachs the map, the visual reflects their choices and allows them to change them around using the filters on the left.<br/><br/>

											The second set of wireframes went a slightly different direction. Here, the user approaches the interactive map by way of a
											single page set of sliders to indicate their preferences. I went with sliders because I wanted to indoctrinate the user into
											this slider UI proor to reaching the map. In this version, I also included a "Skip" button that would bypass the interview
											process and lead them directly to the map. Once on the map, I didn;t change too much and instead went the route of being more
											detailed in my planning of this portion. Both versions have a short onboarding screen while the application calculates the user's preferences.<br/><br/>

											The first wireframe flow, the one on the left, can be viewed in a
											browser by clicking <a href="http://ohwc21.axshare.com/#p=bike__or_jog target_blank">this
												link</a>, and the second set of wireframes, on the right, can be found
												<a href="http://ohwc21.axshare.com/#p=landing_page___preferences" target="_blank">here</a>.

									<br/><br/><h3>Visual Designs</h3>
										<br/><br/><br/><br/><p>In creating visual designs, I was really more focused on the map as it is the focal point of this application. Even still, I
											went ahead and played with the two versions of the interview process. This first set of visual designs was created while trying to keep
											that game-like feel of the interview process in mind. In following that, I used bold colors, large icons, the Philadephia skyline,
											and kept the casual sentence structure in hopes of keeping the application fun to use. The goal was to avoid the sterility of a dataset.
											<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>This carried through to the interactive map. The gaol while creating the map was to carry through this warm, fun feeling and try to present
											the data in an artistic way. Ultimately this map is not very usable and not necessarily even pretty.

							<div class="single-info">
									<div>
										<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><p>In this second set of visual designs, I switched to the single-page version of the interview process.
											With this set, I still wanted to maintain a light, casual, fun feel to the experience and avoid sterility, however I
											opted for a more simple approach at accomplishing this. With the completed sentnces on a sliding scale that matched those found in the map,
											I again thoguht this would allow for familiarity of the UI. The decision to use all sliders was to make this indoctrination even more
											rapid while also making it clear that the application undertanded preferences aren't necessarily binary; rather, preferences often lie
											on a spectrum.</p>
											<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>For the second iteration of the interactive map
											design, I fully embraced that thi is a map and sought to include familiar, popular map features life 3D streetviews. I opted for the streetview
											so that the user can have visual validation of the environment in which the pathway being suggested to them; whether that be in the city or in a
											rural area, or on a trail rather than a busy road.

										<h3>Critiques and Input and the final Design</h3>
										<p>After sharing my designs with peers and users, I gained a lot of insights about which interview process was more appealing and how
											to change somethings to arrive at a better version of my application. The consensus on the map design was not surprising and ultimate chose
											the second visual design as the better, more usable interactive map. The population I spoke with was relatively split on appreciating the click-through
											version of the interview process or the single-page. I asked some questions of them and it seemed that if I added a landing page that gave some
											context of the clickable preference questions this may help gain the appeal of users. It was also pointed out to me that return users, as well
											as some first time users, may prefer to skip right to the map. I was sure to add both a landing page for context and a "Skip" button for user
											control. The most surprising suggestion I recieved was to not use a slider for the "Bike or Jog" option, whether on the single-page interview or on the map filters.
											This seems to obvious now, that this wouldn't be a preference on a sliding scale like the others, but rather a distinct statement on which the user would prefer to
											do right now. This final suggestion exemplified the importance for feedback and testing in order to take a step back from your design and gain perspective.</p><br/>

<!-- SOME CONCLUSION?!?!
				<div>
						<div>
							<div class="single-info">
									<div>
										<h3>How this solves the problem and what problems will still need to be addressed</h3>
										<p>The concerns of my users were that they had trouble organizing their raw data,
											maintaining a simple, understandable, browse history, and accurately evaluating information
											they found online. My design sought to address each of these issues saving their searches,
											screenshots, highlights, notes, and browser history into a file tree while the plug in is activated.
											It also has an optional feature to dim sources that may be unreliable for objective information.</p>
											<p>I see equal advantage and disadvantage in flacing the features within or without the brower window.
												For example, I hypothesize that some users may prefer to maintain a full, unobstructed view of the
												content within the browser, while others may compromise this view for the ability to use the window
												in full-screen mode. My next step will be to build wireframes showing interactions with the plug in
												based on a feature map from the secon row. After that, further testing will be necessary to see which
												version users prefer.</p>
